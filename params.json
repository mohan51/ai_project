In the colony, there are three types of bees. Unlike in real life, there is only one employed bee per food source, and therefore there are an equal number of employed bees and food sources. Employed bees try to find a neighbor of relatively close to their food sources. The distance between the food source and its neighbors is a function of a distance to neighbor variable. Employed bees check the fitness of their respective food sources and report back to the hive. Onlooker bees evaluate the fitness of the employed bees relative to the other employed bees, follow the bees to the best food source, therefore reinforcing the fitness of that food source. Scout bees are spawned as food sources are abandoned to search for new food sources. The algorithm terminates after the bees have converged on a single source, or after a set number of epochs.\r\n\r\nBy modifying the function and parameter for distance to neighbor, its apparent that the algorithm converges more slowly towards a solution, but finds solutions more easily. These findings are important to the effectiveness of this algorithm.\r\n\r\n### The general idea of the algorithm ###\r\n\r\nFood sources and employed bees are matched\r\n\r\nWHILE there is no definite solution and the algorithm hasn't looped MAX_EPOCH number of times\r\n\r\n - Each employed bee goes to a food source in her memory and determines a neighbour source, then evaluates its nectar amount and dances in the hive. This neighbor source is a function of the distance parameter.\r\n\r\n - Each onlooker watches the dance of employed bees and chooses one of their sources depending on the dances, and then goes to that source. After choosing a neighbour around that, she evaluates its nectar amount.\r\n\r\n - Abandoned food sources are determined and are replaced with the new food sources discovered by scouts.\r\n\r\n- The best food source found so far is registered.\r\n\r\nReturn the best food sources\r\n\r\n### A Visual Guide ###\r\n\r\nA sample run without any parameter tweaking\r\n\r\nInitial randomize configuration of \"employed bees.\" \r\n![Initial.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/217938213-Initial.png)\r\n\r\nBegins to converge on the global minimum (the origin in this example) after only 10 cycles\r\n![Cycle10.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/1292224664-Cycle10.png)\r\n\r\nAfter all employed bees converge on a solution, \"scout bees\" are spawned\r\n![Cycle85.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/3725638092-Cycle85.png)\r\n\r\nFinal configuration -- Note that all bees from previous iterations have been stacked on the center (0,0) \"food source\"\r\n![Cycle200.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/3228738010-Cycle200.png)\r\n\r\nPerformance of the Artificial Bee Colony without any parameter tweaking\r\n![ArtificialBeeColony.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/1339486431-ArtificialBeeColony.png)\r\n\r\n### Effects of Greater Distance on Convergence ###\r\n\r\nInitial configuration of bees\r\n![1.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/1650011785-1.png)\r\n\r\nConverging on the food source\r\n![10.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/2396434634-10.png)\r\n\r\nThe scout bees are spawned at greater distance from each other\r\n![85.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/681249855-85.png)\r\n\r\nAfter 200 epochs, the algorithm is stopped\r\n![200.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/1341039890-200.png)\r\n\r\nThe results\r\n![results.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/1211122148-results.png)\r\n\r\n### Effects of Smaller Distance on Convergence ###\r\n\r\nInitial configuration of bees\r\n![1.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/3940758951-1.png)\r\n\r\nConverging on the food source\r\n![10.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/2923254128-10.png)\r\n\r\nThe scout bees are spawned at smaller distance from each other\r\n![85.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/599805997-85.png)\r\n\r\nAfter 200 epochs, the algorithm is stopped.\r\n![200.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/1983623346-200.png)\r\n\r\nThe results\r\n![results.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/q4XX5y/images/2380272736-results.png)\r\n\r\n### Thanks ###\r\nJordan Devenport","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
